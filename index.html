                                                    <p>Chip Lord and Doug Michels were architects; Marquez was an art
                                                        student at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana.
                                                        According to Chip Lord, "Ant Farm was founded as an alternative
                                                        architectural practice, kind of an experiment in an attempt to
                                                        subvert normal corporate ways of doing architecture."[2]
                                                        According to Marquez, "Chip and I were living in the mountains
                                                        north of San Francisco, and there was a book meant for kids left
                                                        in a bar near where we lived. It was called ‘The Look of
                                                        Cars,’[3] and there was something on the rise and fall of the
                                                        tail fin. I didn't have a lot to do, so I just sorta drew it up.
                                                        I’ve always loved the Cadillacs."[2]</p>

                                                    millionaires in 1972 in San Francisco, identifying Stanley Marsh 3
                                                    of Amarillo amongst those who might be able to fund one of their
                                                    projects and submitted it to him. Marsh's response began "It's going
                                                    to take me awhile to get used to the idea of the Cadillac Ranch.
                                                    I'll answer you by April Fool's Day. It's such an irrelevant and
                                                    silly proposition that I want to give it all my time and attention
                                                    so I can make a casual judgment of it."[4]Cadillac Ranch was
                                                    originally located in a wheat field, but in 1997, the installation
                                                    was quietly moved by a local contractor to a location two miles
                                                    (three kilometers) to the west, to a cow pasture along Interstate
                                                    40, in order to place it farther from the limits of the growing
                                                    city.[5] Both sites belonged to the local millionaire Stanley Marsh
                                                    3, the patron of the project.[6] Marsh was well known in the city
                                                    for his longtime patronage of artistic endeavors including the
                                                    Cadillac Ranch; Floating Mesa; Amarillo Ramp, a work by land artist
                                                    Robert Smithson; and a series of fake traffic signs throughout the
                                                    city known collectively as the Dynamite Museum.[7] As of 2013,
                                                    Stanley Marsh 3 did not own the Cadillac Ranch;[8] ownership appears
                                                    to have been transferred to a family trust some time before his June
                                                    2014 death.
                                                    Cadillac Ranch is visible from the highway, and though located on
                                                    private land, visiting it (by driving along a frontage road and
                                                    entering the pasture by walking through an unlocked gate) is tacitly
                                                    encouraged. In addition, writing graffiti on or otherwise
                                                    spray-painting the vehicles is now encouraged, and the vehicles,
                                                    which have long since lost their original colors, are wildly
                                                    decorated. Ant Farm artists have encouraged this kind of public
                                                    interaction with the cars.</p>
