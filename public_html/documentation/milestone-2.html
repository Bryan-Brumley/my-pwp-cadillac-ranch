<h1>Content Stategy</h1>
<section>
    <h3>Landing Page</h3>
    <p> The landing page will be one large image with the text Cadillac Ranch centered over the sky.There will be a nav bar at the top with buttons. There will be a button for each section. Upon clicking each button you will be navigated to the corresponding section.</p>
    <h3>Hours & Directions</h3>
    <p>The next section is hours and directions. The hours which is 24/7 will be simply state. Below that I hope to integrate a MapBox API that will allow users to route themselves with the embedded map.</p>
    <h3>Gallery</h3>
    <p>The gallery section will highlight poplar photos of the Cadillac Ranch that I have taken. They won't be links. Just images to see. If possible I want to make them scroll horizontally by clicking arrows on the left and right sides.</p>
    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>The our story section of the page will tell the story of how the Cadillac Ranch originated. As well as answer popular questions like “What crop grows at the Cadillac Ranch?” “What years are the Cadillacs?” The section will also include various statistics on visitor counts and overall location popularity.</p>
    <h3>Contact Us</h3>
    <p>The last section is the contact page. This section will hold a general contact for, our social media links, company email address, and phone number. In this section will be the official Cadillac Ranch logo.
        At the very bottom will be small text providing trademark information for the photos and the art itself.
