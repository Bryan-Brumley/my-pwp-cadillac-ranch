    <h2>Persona</h2>
        <h3> Rhonda Bartosiewicz </h3>

        <q>Getting kicks on Route 66</q>
            <h4>Bio</h4>
                 <p>Ronda I registered nurse from Michigan. She loves everything route 66 related. Over the years she has traveled many sections of the original route 66. Next month she is finally going to make the Chicago to Santa Monica entire route 66                    trip. Rhonda spends most of her time either at work or on her iiPad researching everything americana. Mostly using google on the Safari browser. IF not there she will be on the Pinterest app.</p>
            <h4>Technology</h4>
                 <p>Chromebook user. Mainly uses her 19.9 inch Ipad Pro(2019 model). She mainly uses the Safari browser and the Pinterest app. At the hospital while working she uses various medical software programs on a windows operating system. She has                  an iPhone X running on ios 14.</p>
            <h4>Frustrations and Needs</h4>
                 <p>Rhonda has found that a lot of old Route 66 road side attractions don't have an online presence. No place to see pictures, history, general information, or directions Not being able to find hours and exact address makes it hard to                         plan out a large road trip. Because Rhonda is usually on her iPad she needs this site to run well on a mobile platform. She isn't very tech-savvy so the website needs to be easy to navigate and streamlined.</p>
            <h4>Goal</h4>
                 <p>Rhonda is mainly after getting straight to the point. Where is the Cadillac Ranch? What does it look like? When are they open? How do I get there? She needs a basic yet beautiful landing page to be view the location and get all of the                    facts that puts her there in the near future. A defined simple layout with obvious avenues to pertinent information.</p>
